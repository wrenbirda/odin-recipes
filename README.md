README.md

This is my first read me for my first HTML project. I am following along with the Odin project to make a recipe site. They requested a README.md file to be made. One of the reasons we are instructed to write this file is to aid in self-reflection as we progress.

The skills we are demonstrating with the project is writing HTML for a website, which we will link to other pages, which will hold recipes. It will start out with no CSS, but we will be adding this later.

In this step of the Odin Recipe project, we will be practicing with titling, coding comments, git commits, ordered and unordered lists, headers, writing a head for a document, linking images and linking pages within directories.

I'm very excited to follow along with the Odin project. I am hoping to use the skills I learn here to play around with a Neocities site, where I can build a portfolio for my drawings and fiber art pieces. And of course, a place to show off my blossoming front-end web design skills. ;)
