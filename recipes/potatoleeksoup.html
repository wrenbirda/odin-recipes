  <h1>Potato Leek Soup</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for potato leek soup. It's one of my favorite soups to make, especially in winter. Both potatoes and leeks are hardy and afforadable, and neither are difficlit to find in American, Italian, or Scottish grocery stores. I'd also consider this recipe to be rather bare bones; you can always add to it, as you please.</p>
    <p>If you don't enjoy cream-based recipes, I'd skip this one. It's very filling and has plenty of fat, which I enjoy, but may be a turn off for others. You can always modify it to meet your needs, but I find withou the cream and butter, it's not quite as comforting of a meal.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Leeks</li>
      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Stock or stock cube</li>
      <li>Paremesan cheese or rind</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Parsley (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of my favorite things about cooking dinner is getting to experiment with flavors and how the food cooks down and combines, and getting to reduce food waste and customize my food. Because of all this, I am super anti-recipe, so I don't want to add amounts for anything. A general rlie-of-thumb colid be equal amounts of leeks and potatoes, a handfli of cheese, half an inch of a stick of butter, and more of anything if it needs it. I like to add lemon juice, for example.</p>
