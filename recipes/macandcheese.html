  <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/cheesy.jpeg">

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe I found on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11679/homemade-mac-and-cheese/" target="_blank">AllRecipes</a>. I want to make sure to credit the author, since we are using their photo and their recipe here. They describe this dish as a "classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping". I'm going to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> a few words here so I can practice the skill and show I know how to do it.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Macaroni</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Cheese:
        <ul>
          <li>Cheddar</li>
          <li>Parmesan</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Seasonings:
        <ul>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Pepper</li>
          <li>Paprika</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350*F or 175*C. Butter up an 8" pan.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
      <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
      <li>To make the bread crumb topping:
        <ol>
          <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add bread crumbs, then cook and stir until well-coated and browned.</li>
          <li>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
