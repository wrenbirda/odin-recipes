  <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe I found on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11679/homemade-mac-and-cheese/" target="_blank">AllRecipes</a>. I want to make sure to credit the author, since we are using their photo and their recipe here. They describe this dish as a "classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping". I'm going to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> a few words here so I can practice the skill and show I know how to do it.</p>
